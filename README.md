ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains the ongoing development of the JFL Construction website, originally created as a 1st-year college project using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As of June 5, 2025, the project is being rewritten and upgraded into a dynamic, database-driven system using:

PHP â€“ for server-side scripting and backend logic

MySQL â€“ to store and manage construction project data

Bootstrap â€“ for responsive layout and modern UI components

CSS & JavaScript â€“ for styling and interaction

SweetAlert â€“ for user-friendly popups and alerts (used in index.php)

PHPMailer â€“ for handling contact forms and email features
